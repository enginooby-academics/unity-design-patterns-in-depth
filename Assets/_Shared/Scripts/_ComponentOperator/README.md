+ ComponentOperator has reference to its Unity Component for manipulations in the runtime (vs. modifying Component in Edit Mode). E.g. TransformOperator can set position, change rotation per second, enable to increase scale by input... in game. Other ComponentOperators (of Behaviours) can also activate/deactivate Components. 
+ ComponentOperators are very useful to manually bind event w/o writing extra code, even in specific projects. E.g. Set Player to position X when game is over: in Inspector of GameManager emitting OnGameOver event, assign Player which has TransformOperator and invoke SetPosision(X).
+ Different ComponentOperators can be combined to form a Controller. E.g. PlayerController makes use of RigidbodyOperator (for jump, crouch), AnimatorOperator (to play the corresponding animation for jump, crouch)...
